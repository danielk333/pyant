    This model is a list of the 4 panels. This applies heave approximations on
    the behavior of the gain pattern as the panels move. Considering a linefeed
    of a single panel, it will receive more reflection area if one of the
    adjacent panels move in into the same pointing direction therefor
    distorting the side-lobe as support structures pass but also narrowing the
    resulting beam.None of these effects are considered here and this
    approximation is reasonably valid when all panels are pointing in
    sufficiently different directions.
